# react-native-axios-prac
This project was made to practice the react-native api as well as axios
##Concepts Practiced
- React-Native Components and general API such as Flatlists
- Hooks
- Animations
- Navigation
- Axios requests

One of the toughest thing for me was the animations, and reading the documentation for it. 
It also took a lot of time to create UI elements to go along with my axios practice. The hardest tasks for me was creating the nested Flatlists for multiple responses.
I'm aware that this in crazy inefficient and costs performance, but I just wanted to prove that I could do it with the data presented.

In future projects I intend to Flashlist to replace Flatlist for performance, and potentially eject the project to use more OS specific APIs
